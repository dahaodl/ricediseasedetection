# Rice Disease Detection

Timely detection of plant diseases and pests is one of the major challenges for food security. Failure to detect crop disease and treat it promptly will have serious consequences on food production.

Rice has many unique characteristics different from those mentioned above. Some specific evidence is that the leaves are long and narrow and the symptoms can appear anywhere on the leaves. In addition to leaves, the disease may appear in stems and seeds. Affected areas and healthy areas on the leaves of rice plants usually do not have significant contrast in color. These factors make labeling of rice difficult.

The topic "APPLICATION OF DEEP LEARNING TO DETECTING DISEASES IN PLANT VARIETIES THROUGH IMAGES" aims to build the Deep Convolutional Neuron Network (CNN) system for rice:

- Must identify plants are healthy or not through images of leaves, stems and seeds. If sick, what specific disease was rice, in which part.
- Must work well in different lighting conditions (underexposed, incandescent, normal lighting) and weather (rain, sun, clouds).
- The accuracy of the label classification algorithm must be at least 95% accurate when processing image data, with a variety of sizes and characteristic features in the image, combined with a diverse, heterogeneous image background. .
